            <p>Some fun things about me are that I love to sing, go on adventures, spend time with family, and try new things. For living in America I am pretty short measuring at 5'0". I have a big family with 7 siblings includimg in-laws and it is fantastic.</p>

            <p>Utah is really cool because it is geographically diverse. Like in this picture there are redrock deserts but only 3 hours away we have dense forests. I love always being close to nature and the freedom that brings.</p>
